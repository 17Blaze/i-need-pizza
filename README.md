# I-Need-Pizza

#Story

A major pizzeria's ordering system has just went down and are in need of some immediate help. There ordering system only accepts orders in the form of javascript objects. They have asked us to fix their orders manually until they can get their system back up and running. Lets use our rock star knowledge to help their customers get their pizza.

#Your Mission

You will be using your coding knowledge to transform these orders into javascript objects and make any changes to an order on the fly. 

#Requirements

Below are the orders that need to be fixed. Declare a variable for each order that corresponds with its order number so we don't get them confused.

["order11821": "Customer Name": "James Franko", "Address": "2155 E Lake Dr. Seattle, WA, 11310", "Pizza: "crust": "thin", "Toppings": "peperoni, ham, sausage, olives", "Sauce": "robust marinara", "Sides": "Breadsticks", "Sauces": "Ranch"]

Set the parameters as idNumber, name, intelligenceLevel, superPower, speed, battlePhrase.
Create the key values of the object prototype using this and set their values to the parameter values

this.id = id;
Create an object prototype for three types of robots and pass information, to make them the best robots ever, as the parameters.

var strongestRobot = new BestRobotEver(1, "Super Strong!", 100000000, "Can cut cake with a karate kick!", 100000, "I AM AWESOME");
Create a function called printInformation, set the parameter as the created robot variable, and return the information of the robot.

Call the function printInformation as many times as you can before time runs out!

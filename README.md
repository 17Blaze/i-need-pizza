#Story

A factory deep, deep in the jungles of Hawaii contains the prototypes for the strongest, fastest, and smartest robots in the entire world! And you, as a Junior DevLeague Developer, are one of the only people that can understand the language of these robots!

Your Mission

Use your knowledge of Javascript to create an object prototype of these robots and use the object constructor function to clone as many awesome robots as possible!

Requirements

Create an object prototype called BestRobotEver using an object constructor function

Set the parameters as idNumber, name, intelligenceLevel, superPower, speed, battlePhrase.
Create the key values of the object prototype using this and set their values to the parameter values

this.id = id;
Create an object prototype for three types of robots and pass information, to make them the best robots ever, as the parameters.

var strongestRobot = new BestRobotEver(1, "Super Strong!", 100000000, "Can cut cake with a karate kick!", 100000, "I AM AWESOME");
Create a function called printInformation, set the parameter as the created robot variable, and return the information of the robot.

Call the function printInformation as many times as you can before time runs out!
